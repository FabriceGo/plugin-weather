# Weather plugin

The plugin **Weather** allows you to retrieve meteorological data from one or more cities. It gives access, among other things, to weather forecasts, information on sunrise and sunset, temperature, humidity, wind, etc. The information comes from the website **openweathermap**.

# Plugin configuration

After installing the plugin, you must activate it and then enter your API key.

To get your API key you have to go [here](https://home.openweathermap.org), create an account and then copy your API key to the area provided on the Plugin configuration page.

> **Important**

> You have to wait a few hours before being able to retrieve information following the creation of the account, while the key is active.

# Equipment configuration

Here you find the configuration of your equipment :

-   **Weather device name** : name of your weather equipment
-   **Activate** : makes your equipment active
-   **Visible** : makes your equipment visible on the dashboard
-   **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs
-   **City** : You must put the name of your city followed by the country code, *(Ex : Paris, fr)*

-   **Full display on mobile** : displays all weather information or not on mobile
-   **Image mode** : to display images instead of icons on the widget


By clicking on the tab **Commands**, you will find all the available commands as well as the possibility of logging or not the numerical values. The code (number) according to the conditions can be consulted [at this address](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)

The weather data is refreshed every 30 minutes.

> **Tip**
>
> We advise you to go [here](https://openweathermap.org/find?) in order to check if your city, village is known or not. In which case you will have to find the nearest known city and enter it in the configuration of your equipment to be able to retrieve the information.

> **Tip**
>
> Une fois la recherche de votre ville r√©ussie le site openweathermap vous montre les informations disponibles et vous devriez avoir dans votre navigateur une url du type <https://openweathermap.org/city/2988507>. This number at the end of the url can also be entered in Jeedom equipment instead of Paris, fr for example

>**Important**
>OpenWeather provides a list of information for the next 120 hours; therefore, based on the current time, we only know part of the information on D + 4. Thus, this prediction on D + 4 is refined to become more precise as the current day progresses. For this reason, certain information, such as the MAX temperature reached on D + 4 can only make sense at the end of the day.
